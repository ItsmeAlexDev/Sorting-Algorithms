# A Study into Sorting Algorithms

##  Getting into Sorting Algorithms and some uses for it.

### List of the Algorithms made:
 1. Bogosort;
 2. Bubble Sort;
 3. Cocktail Shaker Sort;
 4. Insertion Sort;
 5. Merge Sort;
 6. Quicksort;
 7. Shellsort.
#### There other sorting algorithms, but this seems to be already a good base for learning in the future.

 ### List of uses for the Sorting Algorithms:
 1. Binary Search;
 2. Finding the highest value in an array;
 3. Finding the lowest value in an array.
#### There are other uses for sorting, but I don't think it's gonna be of much use/learning for me to make them.
